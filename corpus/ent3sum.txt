The romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, written and directed by Karan Johan (his sixth film and the first since Student of the Year, 2012), stars Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in pivotal roles, with cameos by Fawad Khan, Lisa Hayden, Alia Bhatt and Shah Rukh Khan.

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is essentially the story of a young man named Ayan (Ranbir Kapoor) who is in search of true love in a selfish and materialistic world. Ayan is filthy rich and has all the time in the world to pursue his quixotic adventures. 
But what's difficult to come to terms with is a film about love that tends to depict human relationships with an outrageous sense of levity. Every character in the movie is utterly selfish. 
Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is rife with homages to old Hindi film songs (Mohd. Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Nur Jahan... you name it) and the characters' mannerisms seem deeply influenced the traditional melodrama of Bollywood films. 
The film runs high on cliches (he even introduces cancer as a plot device!) and it seems as if Johar is grasping at straws to give the film some semblance of closure.  Still if you are desperately looking for some escapist entertainment you can certainly give it a try.
