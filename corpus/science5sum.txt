The number of wildfires on public lands is up 500 percent since the late 1970s.

Caused by an illegal campfire, a fire scorched more than 130,000 acres, mostly in the Los Padres National Forest. The effort cost a bulldozer operator his life, destroyed 57 homes, and cost $236 million — the costliest fire in U.S. history.

Ten of California’s 20 largest wildfires burned in the last ten years. Last summer, southern California temperatures exceeded 120°F during a record-breaking heat wave, setting the stage for life-threatening fires.
Additional consequences of climate change, like warmer winters, reduced snowpack and earlier spring snowmelt have favored pine beetle infestations, which also harm trees. The U.S. Forest Service estimates that extreme heat and drought killed 66 million trees in the Sierra Nevada forest since 2010.

Carbon pollution will only continue these trends, destroying natural treasures and endangering the lives of firefighters and residents.
