Andy Murray is fighting mental and physical fatigue as he strains to knock Novak Djokovic off the top of the tennis mountain. 
In Djokovic's absence from the Tour Murray was racking up win after win to move tantalisingly close to him in the ATP rankings; he would displace Djokovic as world No1 if he won the final and Djokovic were to fall in the semis. He will have diminished support against Pouille, who slid 21 aces past Feliciano Lopez and was gifted the result, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, when the Spaniard double-faulted on match point after two hours of a very tight contest.
There are as many locker-room opinions about Murray's chances of overtaking Djokovic as there are among commentators on the US presidential puzzle.
