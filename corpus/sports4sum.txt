The Chicago Cubs did just that, shattering their 108-year championship drought in epic fashion: with an 8-7, 10-inning victory over the Cleveland Indians in Game 7, which began on Wednesday night, carried into Thursday morning and seemed to end all too soon.


"We're world champions," Rizzo said in the alcohol-soaked visitors' clubhouse after he had taken a break from embracing the actor Bill Murray. "The Chicago Cubs are world champions. Let that sink in."

Thousands of fans lingered for nearly an hour after the game, moving into the field level of the stadium, waving the ubiquitous W flags, singing the victory anthem "Go Cubs Go" and roaring when Rizzo held up the ball he had caught for the final out.

Meanwhile, in this matchup of long-suffering franchises, the Indians' suffering will carry on longer. They have not won since 1948 and the excruciating way in which they suffered the defeat, with three consecutive losses will take its place atop a list that until now was topped by the 1997 World Series, in which the Indians lost a ninth-inning lead, and eventually the Series, to Florida.
The roller coaster of a game took place in an unusually neutral environment, with so many of the Cubs' passionate and well-heeled fans finding their way into the stadium.
