The former Olympic Stadium, now home to West Ham United, is facing operational losses running into millions of pounds for years to come due to problems finding a naming-rights partner and hugely increased costs for retractable seating, the Guardian can reveal.
And yet it is understood that after a naming-rights deal fell through in the summer and the full extent of the increased costs of moving the seats back and forth to make way for a running track became clear, there is a black hole in the budget that makes it unlikely the stadium will break even for the foreseeable future.
Costs are so high partly because the seats have to be stored off-site in a specific configuration to enable them to be put back again, like a giant jigsaw puzzle. 
There is also understood to be concern over whether the stadium configuration can be returned to football mode following the World Athletics Championships in time for West Ham to play their first home game of the 2017-18 season, despite the fact they already have agreement from the Premier League to play their first two matches away from the London Stadium.
It is understood Khan and his City Hall team found out only recently about the issue with the additional 51m overspend and ongoing increase in operational costs related to the seating problems.
