Three days after Tiger Woods committed to his first PGA Tour event in 14 months, he abruptly withdrew, leaving this week's Safeway Open with twice as many tickets sold as a year ago but a fraction of the star power.

Since his five-victory season in 2013, Woods has acquired a kind of scar tissue that no amount of vitamin E will ameliorate. 

Woods, 40, appears to be experiencing performance anxiety, and really, who in his position would not feel a little like the emperor with no game? In the statement on his website, Woods described his game as "vulnerable and not where it needs to be."


A winner of 79 tour events, Woods missed all four majors this year for the first time since he turned pro in August 1996. 
If he compares his shots now with his shots then, Woods is never going to feel ready. That does not mean he cannot compete.
