Of the 1,450 or so human pathogens, only a few have the ability to rapidly cause disease 
and kill. It’s known as Staphylococcus aureus - commonly 
referred to as Staph.
 Our bodies can safely 
co-exist with this bacterium as it poses no immediate threat. However, if the bacterium 
can find its way into tissues and the bloodstream, troubles are likely to occur. These 
include diseases such as acne, mastitis, impetigo, and the life-threatening conditions 
known as toxic shock syndrome and sepsis.The bacterium 
has a variety of mechanisms to injure the human body. Most of these chemicals arise quickly
 and have a drastic impact on the way our ability to function.

The team worked with both Staph and another member of the genus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
 which also may be called Epi. This species made for a great control as it is a member of
  our natural human microbial flora, and usually harmless. The team acquired blood samples from individuals
 for use in laboratory tests. In the lab, either Staph or Epi was used to ‘infect’ the blood.
  The effects of the two on immune function were then examined.Epi bacteria seemed to be controlled quite easily as it was 
 tightly bound to B-cells. 

The culprit system was a group of genes known as S. aureus exoprotein expression 
(abbreviated to SaeR/S).SBut for this study, the researchers wanted to 
 venture even deeper into the system to uncover which of the molecules arising from this system were involved.
