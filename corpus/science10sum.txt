Water.It’s our most precious 
commodity and one that is growing increasingly scarce.
Friesen developed Source, a solar panel that draws moisture from the air we breathe and 
condenses it into drinkable water.
“What we set out to do is to develop a solar panel that makes drinking water
 instead of electricity.”
 Zero Mass Water developed a material that
 acts like those grains of rice, absorbing water from the air.
Water is extracted from that material and purified. Source adds calcium and magnesium to
 match the flavor and pH of bottled water, producing 5 liters each day – enough to sate a 
 family of four.
Because Source is powered entirely by solar energy, it can operate far from a power grid 
or centralized water supply. 

Friesen says panels are built to last and maintenance is easy. R
 A machine that can draw 
 moisture from the air would be eminently useful for families in poor, remote areas.
