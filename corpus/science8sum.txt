The number of heart 
attack hospital admissions was three times higher than before the storm, and has not 
abated, not even ten years later.

“Stress contributes to heart attacks, and we had a major disaster that disrupted the whole
 city,” he says. 

 “With climate change, we are seeing an increase in extreme weather events all around the
  world, and it’s important for us to understand how these factors affect the heart.”

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. More than half a million
 people annually experience their first heart attack, and about 200,000 have a second one,
  according to the American Heart Association.
 “These are individuals who likely had underlying high blood pressure, diabetes or other
  risk factors, who may not have had access to either their medications or to a healthcare
   provider.”

Irimpen and his colleagues also found that patients were significantly more likely to have
 other risk factors for heart attack post-Katrina than before the hurricane, including 
 coronary artery disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They were 
 also more likely to be smokers.

Some, he adds, may have had an existing predisposition to heart disease “that reached a 
tipping point because of the devastation and related stress of Katrina, and 
they didn’t know it themselves.”
