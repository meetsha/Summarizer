It was rain, not wind, that dealt the most damage as Matthew rumbled ashore.
Hurricane Matthew upended lives in the Southeast over the weekend, killing at least 33 people in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, while floods cut power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses
Wind speed is a good proxy for the lethal force of a hurricane. that inundate coastal towns. But wind speed doesn’t tell the whole story. There’s also rainfall. Even a mild-mannered Category 1 or 2 hurricane can prove catastrophic if it produces enough rain. Hurricane Matthew dumped 18 inches on parts of North Carolina
Climate change is fueling more powerful hurricanes that spin up faster and deliver more rain. When it comes to extreme precipitation, the human fingerprint is clear. As the atmosphere heats up, it holds more water and produces heavier downfalls.
As weather grows more extreme, meteorologists will need to find a better way to communicate the risks to the public.
