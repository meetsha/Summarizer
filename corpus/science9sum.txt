China's taken another leap forward, with the launch of its largest ever rocket, 
the Long March 5 ("Chang Zheng 5" in Chinese) on November 3.
With a fuselage skin only 3 mm 
 thick, the LM-5's safety features include doubly redundant critical systems, such as 
 electronic controls. LM-5's rocket motors burn liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen (LOX/LH),
  with only water as a byproduct, making it very environmentally friendly compared to 
  previous Long March rockets, which used dinitrogen tetroxide and the carcinogenic 
  unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine.
The LM-5 has a payload faring diameter of 5.2 meters, enabling it to carry much wider 
cargos than smaller previous Chinese rockets. This is critical for payloads like permanent
 space station modules and large diameter spy satellites. 
 Objects in GEO 
 are high enough to stay over the same geographical location, making them critical for 
 activities which require continuous line of sight to specific areas, like communications 
 and navigation.
The LM-5 has a long mission manifest in the years to come.More heavy 
 lifting will follow, for the 20-ton modules of the Chinese permanent space station. 
 Potential future missions after that include launching large spy satellites, and even a 
 possible manned lunar mission involving multiple LM-5s.
