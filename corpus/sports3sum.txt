By way of a recap, Smith and his fellow gymnast Luke Carson were filmed at a wedding shouting Allahu Akbar and mimicking a prayer pose, and the video found its way to the Sun last month. The same type of people who don't trust the public to vote for the right sublebrities in meaningless competitions also don't trust the public to be able to come to its own conclusions about an obviously stupid twat like Louis Smith.
This is one of those debates where it sharpens the focus to consider the individuals lining up on each side. 
As for British Gymnastics, it doesn't appear to be anywhere near learning any useful lessons - but then, it takes its lead from the benighted fools at UK Sport, who bang on about the privilege of representing a country at the same time as cravenly denying that country's essential freedoms.Governing bodies have long come down like a ton of bricks on any athlete who gets political - yet I can scarcely think of anything more absurdly political than British Gymnastics operating a blasphemy law.
