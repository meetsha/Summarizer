The cover of the picture book Charlie the Choo-Choo by Beryl Evans, illustrated by Ned Dameron, is splayed with a glowing blurb from horror great Stephen King: "If I were ever to write a children's book, it would be just like this!"

In The Waste Lands, Jake Chambers buys the book at a bookstore called the Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind and reads it. Despite the positive depiction of Charlie, he reacts with suspicion: "Jake found that he did not trust the smile on Charlie the Choo-Choo's face. You look happy, but I think that's just the mask you wear, he thought."

Unless you want to teach your small children a particularly jolting lesson about the grimness of mortality, this might not be a book to bring home for your 2-year-old. But, for fans, it's a brilliant tie-in to King's expansive Dark Tower universe.
